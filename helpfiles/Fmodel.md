#### Here you can change the Harvest control Rule (HCR) for the selected species.

The HCR defines dynamically the fishing mortality (F), such that F for each year depends on the the stock size at the beginning of the year.

There are three rules to determine F:

<p> <img src="fixed_F.png"  width="120" height="120" style="float:left" >  <h4>Fixed F:</h4> F is fixed at the F target value, and is independent of stock size.  </p>
<br> <br> <br> <br>


<p> <img src="AR_F_SSB.png"  width="120" height="120" style="float:left"> <h4>F from SSB:</h4> F depends on Spawning Stock Biomass(SSB) and the two trigger values T1 and T2. F is zero when SSB is less than T1 and F is at target F when SSB is above T2 </p>

<br> <br> <br> 


<p> <img src="AR_F_TSB.png"  width="120" height="120" style="float:left">  <h4>F from TSB:</h4> F depends on Total Stock Biomass(TSB)SSB and the two trigger values T1 and T2. F is zero when TSB is less than T1 and F is at target F when TSB is above T2 </p>

Remember to **Update option table** when you have changed values for a species
